# PID Controlled Single Axis Solar Tracker

## üìñ Introduction

This project is a **PID-controlled single axis solar tracker** designed
to increase solar panel efficiency by automatically adjusting its
orientation to follow the sun's position throughout the day. Unlike
static panels, the tracker uses **feedback control** to continuously
optimize the panel's angle, ensuring maximum sunlight capture.

The system applies a **PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative)
algorithm** for smooth and stable motion, preventing unnecessary
oscillations and extending the lifespan of the mechanical components.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üîé Project Overview

-   The tracker uses **light-dependent resistors (LDRs)** as sensors to
    detect sunlight intensity on different sides of the panel.\
-   A **servo/DC motor** is controlled by an **Arduino/ESP32 (depending
    on your build)** to rotate the panel along one axis (East--West).\
-   The **PID algorithm** ensures precise angular positioning by
    minimizing error between left and right LDR readings.\
-   Designed for **renewable energy optimization** and as a **practical
    implementation of control systems in mechatronics**.

## üåü Key Features

-   ‚úÖ **PID feedback control** for smooth tracking and reduced
    oscillations.\
-   ‚úÖ **Single-axis movement** (East--West tracking).\
-   ‚úÖ **Real-time sunlight intensity sensing** with LDRs.\
-   ‚úÖ **Increased energy efficiency** compared to static panels.\
-   ‚úÖ **Low-cost design** using off-the-shelf components.\
-   ‚úÖ **Educational demonstration** of PID tuning and renewable energy
    systems.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1.  **Sensors:** Two LDRs are placed at different positions on the
    panel. They measure sunlight intensity.\
2.  **Error Calculation:** The system computes the difference between
    the two LDR values (left vs.¬†right).\
3.  **PID Control:**
    -   *Proportional* adjusts based on immediate error.\
    -   *Integral* corrects accumulated offset.\
    -   *Derivative* stabilizes the response by damping sudden changes.\
4.  **Actuator Control:** The calculated PID output drives a servo/DC
    motor, rotating the panel until the error approaches zero (balanced
    light on both LDRs).\
5.  **Tracking:** The panel keeps adjusting throughout the day,
    following the sun across its path.
